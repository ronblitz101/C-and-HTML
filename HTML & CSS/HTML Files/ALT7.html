		<p>I awoke 6 hours after getting to sleep. My sleeping hours typically range from completely sleep deprived to over-body-aching-sleep. 
		I was too sluggish to get up right away, so I scrolled through TikTok and watched a few clips. Then after, an hour had passed. 
		I hastily made my bed and exited my room. My entire family surfaced as soon as I passed through the curtains. To my surprise, I was greeted by my <b>35-year-old sister, Michelle</b>. 
		Because of our 17-year age gap, she is like a second mother to us. I respect her, am a little afraid of her, but manage to get along with her as my sister. 
		This is a time when she has an opportunity to visit us, as she is already living with her own family, and working as a Real Estate Broker. 
		Despite of the mere fact that we only see each other like 12 to 15 times a year, we manage to occasionally have sibling talks because, apparently, she considers me "more mature" than my brother. 
		Whose sitting across the television, scrolling through his phone. <b>John Michael</b>, or as we call him, JM, is a <b>19-year-old</b> college freshman. We're pretty close, realistically since he's only a year older than me. 
		However, I am frequently annoyed by him due to his messiness and laziness. I get to hear his take on social concerns, especially in this failing nation. He's basically a socialist. 
		He is well-versed in history, currently completing a BA in History at the University of the Philippines.</p>

		<p>I went to wash myself up as I see my mother, <b>Babes, 58</b>, cooking in the kitchen. I'm brushing my teeth while smelling an aromatic meal. 
		My mum has been working every day since before we were born. And raised all three of my brothers all alone. She has been single for approximately 15 years. 
		She is a strict mother in terms of our attitude, ensuring that we study well while maintaining our individuality. A great parent, indeed. 
		I walked to my younger brother's room as soon as I finished. He's there, as usual, alienating himself from others. 
		<b>Patrick James</b>, or PJ, is an extreme introvert, but because we're close, I get to witness his behavior. He's <b>three years younger than me</b> and a junior high school graduate. 
		He began tickling me as soon as I approached him. Then my nephew went to join us. <b>JD, a 9-year-old youngster</b> who enjoys Roblox, approached me and said, "Tito Aaron, see what I've built." 
		He's well-mannered and knows how to get along with others. My brother's polar opposite. JD's father, <b>Jordan, 39</b>, called him. JD and I exited the room. 
		Jordan is the husband of my sister. He's been a member of the family for over 15 years. He's a nice and generous person who treats us like brothers, which we appreciate. 
		Since a long time, the three of them had been a pack. And, of all, my name is <b>Aaron Gabriel, and I am an 18-year-old</b> senior high school graduate. 
		Even if just the 4 of us get to bond frequently, I am grateful that my sister is able to bond with us. 
		Despite the fact that we grew up without a father, our family of seven completes my heart, and I am delighted with this family, the Silerio plus Sto. Domingo.</p>
