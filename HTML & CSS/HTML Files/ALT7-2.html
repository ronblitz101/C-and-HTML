		<h2><br>In your own words answer the following questions below. Answer them in English with 3-5 sentences.<br></h2>
		
		<h3><br> 1. What do you think is the importance of knowing Tags and Attributes? (5pts)</h3>
		<p> = Knowing the various Tags and Attributes when creating a website, particularly in HTML, enables the developer to comprehend the spine or structure of 
		the website they are creating. Significantly, using the appropriate Tags and Attributes allows a website to be a website. Heading tags, for example, help readers 
		in determining which information is more significant by employing these forms with varying text sizes. Furthermore, Attributes helps the website by accentuating details, 
		adding elements, or improving the website's design.</p>
		
		<h3><br> 2. What do you think would be the best HTML editor to use for beginners? Share your thoughts about this editor 
		(e.g., cite some features and explain briefly what you like about it). (5pts)</h3>
		<p> = Notepad++, in my opinion, is the best HTML editor for beginners. Unlike Notepad, this editor supports practically all programming languages, including C++, 
		JavaScript, and HTML. This has a Guided Indentation (Notepad++, Wikipedia, 2022) feature that I love since it helps me navigate through my coding by highlighting 
		its tag partner. This is a simple editor, but it is a highly helpful, simplistic, and user-friendly tool.</p>
		
		<h4><br> BONUS: Insert the Bible Verse Psalm 45:1 below:</h4>  
		<p><b><i>  For the director of music. To the tune of “Lilies.” Of the Sons of Korah. A maskil. A wedding song. <br>My heart is stirred by a noble theme
			as I recite my verses for the king; my tongue is the pen of a skillful writer.</i></b></p>
